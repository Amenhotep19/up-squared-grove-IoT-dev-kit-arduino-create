This tutorial shows you how to use Multithreading on the Up2 board to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.

## What you'll learn
* How to multithread code to multitask within the Arduino Create environment.

## Gather your materials
* [UPÂ²\* board](http://www.up-board.org/upsquared)

## Setup
No additional setup is required.

## Get the code
This example can be found in the Arduino Create IDE under `Examples > FROM LIBRARIES > UP SQUARED GROVE IOT DEV KIT > Multithreading`.

Before running, open the Monitor in the IDE.

After running should see `Hello from the parent process!` and `"Hello from the child process!` at different intervals.

## How it works
The "fork" function is a system function included in unix-based operating systems. It can be used to spawn a child process, and returns the process id (pid) of the resulting child. The child's pid variable will contain the initial value, which in this case is preset to "0".
