# Multithreading
This tutorial shows you how to use Multithreading on the Up2 board to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.

## What you'll learn
* How to multithread code to multitask within the Arduino Create environment.

## Gather your materials
* [UPÂ²\* board](http://www.up-board.org/upsquared)

## Setup
Upload the code to the Up2 board, then open the Serial terminal.

## How it works
The "fork" function is a system function included in unix-based operating systems. It can be used to spawn a child process, and returns the process id (pid) of the resulting child. The child's pid variable will contain the initial value, which in this case is preset to "0".
