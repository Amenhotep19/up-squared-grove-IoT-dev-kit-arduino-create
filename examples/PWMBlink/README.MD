# PWM
This tutorial shows you how to use PWM on the Up2 board to fade an LED on and off.

## What you'll learn
* How to access the PWM pins on the Up2 board
* Use UPM via the Arduino Create development environment

## Gather your materials
* [UPÂ²\* board](http://www.up-board.org/upsquared)
* [GrovePi+](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/wiki/GrovePi%2b)
* [Grove LED](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Green-LED-p-1144.html)

## Setup
Connect the LED breakout to the GrovePi+ board on the D5 port.

## How it works
PWM stands for Pulse Width Modulation, and is the process of cycling power to a device on and off at a high rate, allowing it to mimic the effects of voltage changes. This allows us to dim an LED without needing a digital to analog converter of any sort.
